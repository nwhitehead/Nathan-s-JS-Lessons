{% block title %}What's a Closure?{% endblock %}

{% block description %}
<p>
Ever wonder what closures are and how they work?
You can learn about this advanced programming concept right now through
interactive lessons in JavaScript.
</p>

<p>Let's get started!</p>

<div class="hr"></div>

<p>Here is an example of some JavaScript code.  Doesn't it look pretty?</p>

<textarea class="demo">var f = function (x) {
    return x + 1;
}</textarea>

<p>Don't worry, we're not just going to sit around and look at pretty
code.  We're going to be writing code!</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>Here's code that declares <tt>x</tt> is a variable, and
then assigns <tt>x</tt> the value <tt>5</tt>.</p>

<textarea class="demo">var x;
x = 5;</textarea>

<p class="problem">Now you try.  Declare that <tt>y</tt> is a variable and then
assign it the value <tt>7</tt>.  Click "submit" when you think you have it.</p>

{% block jsoptions %}
default_code = 'var ';
add_bool_test('typeof y === "number"', 'y is a number');
add_assert_test('y', '7');
{% endblock %}

{#
var y;
y = 7;
#}

var next_lesson = '1010';
